                        We plan to build a series of IAI product that make your life easier. Our first
                        product is a individualized AI Inbox client that separates emails you care about
                        from the ones you don't, and auto tagging your emails according to your specific
                        needs.

                                Thywis values privacy as a law rather than a virtue. Every person from
                                executives to interns have the right and responsibility to make sure that
                                every decision made by the company takes privacy protection into account.
                                We strive our best to protect our customer's information from external
                                hazard and internal misuse.
